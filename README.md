## Overview

This is a cash register and will take the amount of an item that the customer enters. Then it takes the amount the customer gives to the cash register and will have multiple outcomes depending on the amount the custom gives. If the customer enters an amount for the item and hands over too little currency, the cash register will have an error message that displays. If the customer gives the cash register the exact amount of the item being purchased the cash register will prompt a message that says so. If the customer gives more money than the item being purchased is worth, the cash register will calculate the amount of currency the customer gets back. The cash register will only give back currency in twenty dollar bills, ten dollar bills, five dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The message back from the cash register will show; The amount of the item, the amount of cash the customer gives, and the tally of each dollar or cent (i.e., 1 twenty, 1 ten, 1 five, 3 ones, 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies.). If one of the dollars or cents is not being used, then it will not be displayed in the message back from the cash register.

## Lessons Learned 

Methods can make the main look more organized if used. 

Math isn’t a strong suit for me and once you figure out how the equation should look then the next challenge comes when you have to put it in code.

Hotkeys/ shortcuts are very helpful

Copy and paste can save some time

Going back to previous lessons in Eclipse from the past week/s of class is the best tool for me

Don’t stay up late trying to figure it all out after a full day of class. 

Take breaks to get a fresh set of eyes on code.

Saturday 10-2 TAs are so beneficial!!!

Sysout variables that I’ve created though the process of my code can help understand what my code is or isn’t doing. 

Order of code matters or else the math might not be correct.
